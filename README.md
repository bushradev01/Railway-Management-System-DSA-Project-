🚆 Railway Management System
(Data Structures & Algorithms Project – C++)
📌 Project Overview

The Railway Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ that simulates real-world railway reservation and passenger management operations.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of Data Structures, specifically a Doubly Linked List, to efficiently manage passenger records.

It was developed as part of a Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) course project.

🎯 Objectives

To implement a real-world system using core data structures.

To understand dynamic memory allocation.

To practice linked list operations (insertion, deletion, traversal).

To apply searching and sorting algorithms.

To strengthen problem-solving and logic-building skills.

🛠 Technologies Used

Language: C++

Concepts:

Doubly Linked List

Dynamic Memory Allocation

Object-Oriented Programming

Searching Algorithms

Sorting Techniques

File Handling (if used)

📚 Data Structure Used
🔹 Doubly Linked List

Each passenger record is stored in a node containing:

Passenger Name

Ticket Number

Seat Number

Train Details (if applicable)

Next Pointer

Previous Pointer

Why Doubly Linked List?

✔ Efficient insertion and deletion
✔ Bi-directional traversal
✔ Dynamic size
✔ No fixed memory limit

✨ Features

The system provides the following functionalities:

🎟 Ticket Management

Book a ticket

Cancel a ticket

Modify passenger details

Swap passenger records

🔎 Searching

Search by Ticket Number

Search by Passenger Name

📊 Sorting

Sort passengers by:

Ticket Number

Name

📈 Additional Functionalities

Display all passengers

Count total passengers

Traverse forward and backward

🧠 Core Concepts Implemented

Node creation and deletion

Head and tail pointer management

Memory management using new and delete

Edge case handling:

Empty list

Single node

Deleting first or last node

Invalid search input
